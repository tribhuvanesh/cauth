\begin{abstract}
Static Authentication methods, although providing a rigid and secure framework to this one-time authentication session, do not provide authentication of the user throughout the session. This leaves the possibility of an imposter gaining access in multiple scenarios.\\
The goal of \emph{Continuous Authentication} is to authenticate the user right from the initial stages of log-in through log-out.
This can be implemented by extrapolating the tried-and-tested static authentication techniques thoughout the session.
But, this introduces new challenges, since these "one-time authentication" techniques are computationally expensive, restricts the user's movement and postures in front of the system, require extra expensive hardware and deviates the user from his work-flow.
In these situations, the user no longer remains uninterrupted by the authentication process in the background.\\
This project proposes Continuous Authentication, using login through conventional passwords followed by authentication using two modes - hard and soft biometrics till logout. The hard biometric trait - facial features, is chosen so that the user need not invest in any additional expensive hardware. The noise inherent in the process of face recognition, is managed by using a machine learning algorithm which captures the temporal data and expresses it as confidence. The soft traits are used in phases when this confidence is high to relieve the CPU of comparatively high computation.

% FIGURES
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
% There are many ways to include figures in the text. We will assume
% that the figure is some sort of EPS file.
%
% The outdated packages epsfig and psfig allow you to insert figures
% like: \psfig{filename.eps} These should really be done now using the
% \includegraphics{filename.eps} command.  
%
% i.e.,
%
% \includegraphics{file.eps}
%
% whenever you want to include the EPS file 'file.eps'. There are many
% options for the includegraphics command, and are outlined in the
% on-line documentation for the "graphics bundle". Using the options,
% you can specify the height, total height (height+depth), width, scale,
% angle, origin, bounding box "bb",view port, and can trim from around
% the sides of the figure. You can also force LaTeX to clip the EPS file
% to the bounding box in the file. I find that I often use the scale,
% trim and clip commands.
% 
% \includegraphics[scale=0.6,trim=0 0 0 0,clip=]{file.eps}
% 
% which magnifies the graphics by 0.6 (If I create a graphics for an
% overhead projector transparency, I find that a magnification of 0.6
% makes it look much better in a paper), trims 0 points off
% of the left, bottom, right and top, and clips the graphics. If the
% trim numbers are negative, space is added around the figure. This can
% be useful to help center the graphics, if the EPS file bounding box is
% not quite right.
% 
% To center the graphics,
% 
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics...
% \end{center}
% 
% I have not yet written good documentation for this, but another 
% package which helps in figure management is the package ieeefig.sty,
% available at: http://www-isl.stanford.edu/people/glp/ieee.shtml
% Specify:
% 
%\usepackage{ieeefig} 
% 
% in the preamble, and whenever you want a figure,
% 
\figdef{filename}
% 
% where, filename.tex is a LaTeX file which defines what the figure is.
% It may be as simple as
% 
% \inserteps{filename.eps}
%
% or
% \inserteps[includegraphics options]{filename.eps}
% 
% or may be a very complicated LaTeX file.
